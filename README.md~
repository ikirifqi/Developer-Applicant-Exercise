# Web Developer Applicant Exercise

**Please note:** your code will be tested on Ruby 1.9.3.

1. In the *simple_refactoring_exercise* directory you will find some Ruby code that needs to be refactored.
    * An rspec spec is provided
    * Please [refactor](http://www.refactoring.com) the implementation.  Clarity and duplication are a given, flawed implementation is also likely.
    * Please note: feel free to change the specs, but they should all be passing when you turn in your code.
    * Leave a note about what you refactored and why.  Calling specific named smells and specific named refactorings should be the norm.
2. Commit and Push your code to your public repository on Github.
4. Send the Github URL to david(@)kiranatama(.)com
