# Web Developer Applicant Exercise

Here is the reason why I refactor the code:
1. The string replacement algorithm is bad and not rubyish style, then I make change to more rubyish style.
2. It took many lines, then I make change to only eats 8 lines code.
3. The method produce same output but I'm sure this is with the best algorithm.

Thank you
